# Slim - A case for Watchy

**Note** This case has been expanded and improved by yik3z, you're better off using their version at https://github.com/yik3z/Watchy-CAD

---

A watch case carefully designed to add as little bulk as possible. The case consists of only two parts: a back that fits underneath your Watchy and a front plate that goes on top. Just thread your strap through the hoops and you're ready to go.
